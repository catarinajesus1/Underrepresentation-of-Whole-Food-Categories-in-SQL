# A SQL Analysis of Whole Foods Brand Representation

The focus was to reply the following question: Is the conglomerate of Whole Food brands underrepresented in any category?

This repository contains the analysis of Whole Foods Market's product categories, focusing on the representation of Whole Foods Brand within these categories. The study utilizes real and expected data on the number of products per category in Whole Foods Brand and other brands, employing chi-square analysis to evaluate the association between categories and the Whole Foods Brand.

The results reveal a weak association, with a probability of 0.056%, suggesting that some categories within the conglomerate of Whole Foods Brand may be underrepresented. The study identifies specific categories, including Beauty, Beverages, Body Care, Bread Rolls and Bakery, Lifestyle, Meat, Produce, Snacks Chips Salsas and Dips, and Wine Beer Spirits, as potentially underrepresented.

The analysis also explores the representation of kosher and vegan products within Whole Foods Brand. Despite offering a diverse range of kosher products, the study highlights that the proportion of kosher food from Whole Foods Brand remains lower compared to other brands. Additionally, the adoption of a plant-based diet is on the rise, and the study suggests that Whole Foods Market could enhance sales and profits by expanding its variety of Whole Foods Brand vegan and kosher products, maintaining competitive prices.
